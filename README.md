# gaming-tokens
 
Tokens for playing wargames.

## Creating your tokens

1. Grab a file from the `printables` directory and print it. The desired paper size and token size is in the name (ideally photo paper, but cheaper paper could work too).
2. Take a circle puncher that matches the printed token size and punch out your tokens.
3. Take epoxy resin stickers and stick them on top.

Note the printed token size, circle puncher and stickers need to match in size. The printable provided actually makes the token a bit bigger to avoid white borders after cutting.

## Creating printables

To create your own token file, combine them in software designed to create print documents, like https://www.lucidpress.com/. Make sure the tokens sizes match the circle punchers used.

## Adding new tokens

The `tokens` folder contains token designs as SVG image files. To add a token, copy one and modify, without changing the size or shape of the image.
